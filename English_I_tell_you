##有关英语学习的一点想法

Yeah, fact is fact, but personally speaking, language can be a tool for 
connecting people, and a lens for others to look inside you. You can say
that by observing one's behavior can you form the impression of someone,
but how can you describe your feelings about him or her? I have to admit 
that I have almost no idea about neural science, but I guess that although
you can express your thoughts with the help of a certain language, language
itself can never be a border stopping you from the vast sea of ideas. Other
words, language is a way to output your thoughts, but learning a language
can help you embracing your connections of wires in your brain. The more 
those connections, or rather thoughts, are, the brighter your mind would
be. You'll then find out that you can tell other people about your big 
ideas in any language you've learned. That's what I think the key theory
for learning any language.

是的，这个观点我无法辩驳，但是在我心里，语言是什么？语言是沟通人的工具，是一种
让别人了解你的媒介。你可以说了解一个人可以观察他或她的行为，但是你会如何评价他
或者她的行为？我对神经科学了解甚少，但是我猜想虽然思想的表达形式可以是语言，但
是语言并不是你思想问题的限制。换句话说，我首先想表达我的核心想法，就是语言虽然
不会是你思想的障碍，但是学习一门语言会促进你思想的发展，而这样的思想发展会自然
而然地让你用你所能够使用的语言都可以表达出来。我觉得这一点是语言学习中最需要注
意的东西。
